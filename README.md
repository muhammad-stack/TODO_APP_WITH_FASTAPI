<h1>FastAPI Project<h1>
This is a project that uses FastAPI, a modern, fast, and easy-to-use web framework for building APIs with Python.

<h1>What is FastAPI?<h1>
FastAPI is a web framework that is based on standard Python type hints and ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface). It has several features that make it ideal for building APIs, such as:

Fast: It has very high performance, comparable to Node.js and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
Easy: It is designed to be easy to learn and use, with intuitive and expressive syntax, and great editor support.
Robust: It generates automatic interactive documentation for your API, based on OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards. It also supports dependency injection, authentication, validation, testing, and more.
Scalable: It supports asynchronous code, concurrency, and websockets, allowing you to build scalable and real-time applications.
You can learn more about FastAPI from its official website or its GitHub repository.

<h1>How to install FastAPI using Poetry?<h1>
Poetry is a tool that helps you manage your Python projects and dependencies. It allows you to create virtual environments, specify your dependencies, and publish your packages to PyPI. You can install Poetry by following the official instructions.

To create a FastAPI project using Poetry, you can follow these steps:

Create a new project with poetry new fastapi-project.
Add FastAPI and Uvicorn (an ASGI server) as dependencies with poetry add fastapi uvicorn[standard].
Activate the virtual environment with poetry shell.
Create a file named app.py in the project folder, and write your FastAPI code there. For example:
